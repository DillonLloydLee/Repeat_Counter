BDD SPEC:

1.  Objective:          Search a single letter text for itself.
                        As simple as it could be.
    Main text Input:    "a"
    Search Input:       "a"
    Output:             1

2.  Objective:          Search three words for instances of a
                        single letter.  These three words will
                        not contain additional instances of
                        that letter.
    Main text Input:    "a big dog"
    Search Input:       "a"
    Output:             1

3.  Objective:          Find the letter whether it is capitalized
                        or not.
    Main text Input:    "A big dog is a good dog."
    Search Input:       "a"
    Output:             2

4.  Objective:          Ignore instances where the search is
                        part of another word.
    Main text Input:    "The big dog named Theodore is the thief."
    Search Input:       "the"
    Output:             2

5.  Objective:          Make sure the program still finds the
                        search input if there is punctuation like
                        periods or colons.
    Main text Input:    "ERROR: THE BIG DOG IS LOOSE! ERROR!"
    Search Input:       "ERROR"
    Output:             2

6.  Objective:          Make sure the program can handle any type
                        of search input without an error.
    Main text Input:    "666BATCH_ERROR~!!%: THE BIG DOG IS LOOSE!"
    Search Input:       "666BATCH_ERROR~!!%"
    Output:             1

7.  Objective:          Try searching something long and complex
                        for multiple iterations of the word.
                        This test should hopefully work without
                        any further edits to the function.
    Main text Input:    The first paragraph of J.R.R. Tolkien's The
                        Hobbit
    Search Input:       "HOLE"
    Output:             6
